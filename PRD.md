## Design Direction
The interface should feel professional and technical, reflecting the engineering precision of Revit while remaining approachable for users of all skill levels. Clean, minimal design with generous whitespace and clear visual hierarchy to reduce cognitive load when learning complex software features.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Using a professional blue and warm orange palette that conveys both technical expertise and approachability, with the blue representing trust and reliability while orange highlights key actions and progress.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Professional Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - Conveys technical expertise and reliability, used for main navigation and primary actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Blue Gray (oklch(0.95 0.02 250)) for backgrounds and Neutral Gray (oklch(0.85 0.01 250)) for subtle elements
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 45)) - Draws attention to important actions like "Watch Video" and progress indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background White (oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.25 0.01 250)) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
  - Primary Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓

  - Accent Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should emphasize clarity and technical precision while remaining approachable, using Inter for its excellent readability and modern professional appearance that complements technical documentation.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Panel Names): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Tool Names): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Captions: Inter Regular/14px/medium gray color

## Animations
Subtle and purposeful animations that enhance the professional feel without being distracting, focusing on smooth transitions and gentle hover effects that provide clear feedback for interactive elements.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions between content sections reinforce the organized, systematic approach to learning
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Video thumbnails and navigation elements receive priority animation treatment to guide user focus

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Cards for video thumbnails, Tabs for panel organization, Dialog for full-screen video viewing, Input for search functionality, Progress indicators for completion tracking
- **Customizations**: Custom video player controls, plugin panel iconography, progress tracking visualizations
- **States**: Hover effects on video cards, active states for current panel selection, loading states for video content, completed states for watched videos
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for navigation (Play, Search, Grid, List), custom icons for Revit panels to match plugin interface
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px base spacing with 24px gaps between major sections, 8px internal padding for compact elements
